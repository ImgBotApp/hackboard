          <p class="card-text lead">
          <p>   Purpose: A game around which we can build our coding school.
              Whatâ€™s the problem: What if we could create a simple text-based game, where learning becomes a journey? Where we have a character that levels up, collects points, money, purchases new equipment, but most of all: writes lines of code. Games like this can be addictive, give structure, help observe progress, bring people together and much more. And the best thing is: we can learn by building our own infrastructure!</p>
