CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT

Purpose: Making lots of purchases of second hand stuff around a city, in an efficient way.
What’s the problem: When making many purchases second hand, it may be cheaper but you’ll be travelling through all of the city. But with a group of people furnishing a place together, for example when refugees code finds a new headquarter, it would allow a group to look for nice offers together.

User Stories:

As a buyer, I want to add something to a city map.
As a seller I want one person to talk to.
As a user I need to see where in the city I live and where the action is.
As a group of people I want to have an overview of what products are being looked at, what can be purchased, and how much money is still available.
As an organisation I want to democratically furnish a place.
