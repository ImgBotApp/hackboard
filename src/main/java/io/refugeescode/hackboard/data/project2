Text-Based Role-Play-Game RPR

Purpose: A game around which we can build our coding school.
Whatâ€™s the problem: What if we could create a simple text-based game, where learning becomes a journey? Where we have a character that levels up, collects points, money, purchases new equipment, but most of all: writes lines of code. Games like this can be addictive, give structure, help observe progress, bring people together and much more. And the best thing is: we can learn by building our own infrastructure!

As a participant, I want to see my character grow and buy nice things.
As a gamer, I like to see some story line.
As a participant, I want access to all kinds of apps that make my life easier. For food, for sports, for shopping, for voting, and all should be connected.
